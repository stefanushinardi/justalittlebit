On January 24th 2018, I took a flight from SFO to SUB; that was the day I went back forgood. Fast forward today, almost 7 months after that day, I am going to tell you what I've been up to.

### A company

First, I started a company with two good friends of mine: a data analytic / consultancy company. We help company in designing their data pipeline and also provide them with some analytic based on their request. This is quite a change for me. Before I was working solely as an engineer, now I have to meet clients and the whole shebang. Honestly, things are crazy but I believe there is something great for us here.

### Another one

I drink coffee religiously; 2 cups each day to be exact. My morning usually go like this: I wake up, shower, go to the office and grind 50 grams of beans. Then I use my Chemex with 750 grams of water; 100 grams for bloom and the rest in 250 grams batch. Brew time in total is approximately 4:30 minutes. Now, this gives me good and fool proof morning coffee, but I have to say, this process is quite cumbersome. Yet, other alternative is either expensive (buying coffee everyday from a cafe) or taste bad (instant coffee). So I told this problem to my friend who owns a coffee shop and a roastery in Surabaya and together we embark on a journey to find the solution. We are still starting out but we are positive that we are quite close to the answer.

That is probably all that I can share with you guys. I am hopeful for the things that about to come and I am definitely will try my best to document it here. See ya on the next run.
